        <p class="pStyle">Good question, I thought "hey lets take your two fav things, words and presents and see how it
            goes". But on
            a serious note, I wanted to give you something. I dunno, I feel like you deserve to know how much you do
            kinda mean to me. I know the way I acted recently really didn't make it seem that way, but you do. So here
            you go, we have this website trying to show that and just bring back our old shitty conversations we used to
            have.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pStyle">
            So yeah, I'm not sure what this website will contain, but it's going to contain some things I never got
            around to, I never shared with you, and overall just other memories I have.

            were not
            exactly talking, but you were one of the most brilliant mods I could have asked for when I was streaming,
            always there and creating clips and keeping me company when I was alone.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pStyle justifyText">
            During this time, I was really into writing (I even sent you the story I was writing), what you didn't know
            is that you were going to be part of the story. You were going to be one of the villains (I asked you if you
            would rather be a hero or a villain) and thus, Kylie "Dominguez" was born. This was your character design
            next to this fancy text.

            As you can see, you were going to be a majour part of the story, and even when I still plan it all out in my
            head, you still are. I don't want to spoil to much should I ever actually write it, but you had your own
            card, and I love your backstory. In fact, you even own your own art gallery in this story.

            your own art gallery. Because of your amazing and unique art style, I wanted the art gallery to represent
            that.</p>

            It included your own underground bunker where you kept all of your vaults and stolen and forged art (which
            because of your strong art ability you could pull it off). You were a huge part of the money syndicate.

            just wanted to say this kinda month has sucked massively, and I realised how much you actually just make
            each day a little brighter for me. Not a day went by where I wasn't thinking "Is she okay?", "Is she having
            a good break?", "Will I wake up with a message from her". </p>

                        being so far away having quality time is tricky, but honestly, I couldn't have asked for

                        have a friend for life. You are one of the few that know of my therapy, that knows how soft I
                        really am, and how much simple things mean to me. You always do your best to make sure I go to
                        bed with a smile and always give me a reason to just smile throughout the day.

            The thing is that communication is not my strong suit, and I wanted to work on it. But I did it super
            poorly, to the point where I most likely upset you. And for that, I cannot say it enough about how sorry I
            am. You are such a special person and my emotions and feelings around you are fucking mental and I wish I
            could understand them better. But I don't want to hurt you, fuck up, or make you feel like you're worth
            anything less than everything. You are a brillaint person and I know words are not what you like, it's the
            best I can do at the moment.
